# Django-Blog-Project
A blog that allows the primary user to post drafts, that can then be edited or published to the main site. Unregistered users on the site can then
comment on the blogs, which will require approval before being published to the main site. The user login is managed using the Django admin site, create a
superuser to create a login for the site.

This site was built as a learning exercise using Django3.1 and Bootstrap4.
